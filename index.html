            <h1>Let’s Help Those <br /> Who Are More In Need</h1>
            <p>About 26,000 sq km (18%) of Bangladesh is flooded by monsoons every year. At this time, especially in the
                northern part of the country, the Banavasi people are the victims of extreme misery. The As-Sunnah
                Foundation conducts relief activities every year in the flood-hit districts of the country and takes the
                initiative to stand by the needy and helpless people.</p>

        <p id="para3">The importance and virtue of standing by the side of the afflicted people is much greater.
            Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘Whoever relieves the
            suffering of a needy person, Allaah will relieve his suffering in this world and in the Hereafter. As long
            as Allah continues to help the servant, as long as he is engaged with the help of one of his brothers.
            '(Sunan Tirmidhi, Hadith-2945)
            Under this program, an opportunity is created to stand by the side of the needy and miserable people and the
            above hadith is followed.
